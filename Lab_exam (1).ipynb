              "summary": "{\n  \"name\": \"df\",\n  \"rows\": 2225,\n  \"fields\": [\n    {\n      \"column\": \"news\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2127,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Millions go missing at China bank\\n \\n Two senior officials at one of China's top commercial banks have reportedly disappeared after funds worth up to $120m (\\u00c2\\u00a364m) went missing.\\n \\n The pair both worked at Bank of China in the northern city of Harbin, the South China Morning Post reported. The latest scandal at Bank of China will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that China's big four banks are ready for international listings. Government policy sees the bank listings as vital economic reforms. Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. The other is China Construction Bank. Both are expected to list abroad during 2005.\\n \\n They shared a $45bn state bailout in 2003, to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut.\\n \\n However, a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal. Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder. China's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. Officially, one in five loans is not being repaid. Attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. The most high-profile case involved the ex-president of Bank of China, Wang Xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003. Although, he committed the offences whilst running Bank of China in New York, Mr Wang was head of China Construction Bank when the scandal broke. Earlier this month, a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.\\n \\n China's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. The introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector, but links between banks and local government remain strong. Last year, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches, and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised, in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. China's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China's economic boom. But two problems persist. First, inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people. Second, many questionable loans come not from the big four, but from smaller banks. Another high profile financial firm, China Life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following its 2004 New York listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.\\n\",\n          \"Portable PlayStation ready to go\\n \\n Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP) will go on sale in Japan on 12 December.\\n \\n The long-awaited handheld game playing gadget will cost about 19,800 yen (145 euros) when it hits the shelves. At launch 21 games will be available for the PSP, including Need for Speed, Ridge Racer, Metal Gear Acid and Vampire Chronicle. Sony has not yet announced when the PSP will be available in Europe and the US, but analysts expect it to debut in those territories in early 2005.\\n \\n Fifa 2005 is back at the top of the UK games charts, a week after losing it to rival Pro Evolution Soccer 4. Konami's Pro Evo dropped only one place to two, while the only new entry in the top 10 was another football title, LMA Manager 2005, in at number seven. Tony Hawk's Underground 2 held its own at three, while Star Wars Battlefront inched up to four places to four. There was good news for Disney, with the spin-off from the Shark's Tale film moving up the charts into number eight.\\n \\n Fans of the Gran Turismo series in Europe are going to have to wait until next year for the latest version. Sony has said that the PAL version of GT4 will not be ready for Christmas. \\\"The product is localised into 13 different languages across the PAL territories, therefore the process takes considerably longer than it does in Japan,\\\" it said. Gran Turismo 4 for the PlayStation 2 is still expected to be released in Japan and the USA this year.\\n \\n Halo 2 has broken video game records, with pre-orders of more than 1.5 million in the US alone. Some 6,500 US stores plan to open just after midnight on Tuesday 9 November for the game's release. \\\"Halo 2 is projected to bring in more revenue than any day one box office blockbuster movie in the United States,\\\" said Xbox's Peter Moore. \\\"We've even heard rumours of fan anticipation of the 'Halo 2 flu' on 9 November.\\\"\\n\",\n          \"Tomlinson stays focused on Europe\\n \\n Long jumper Chris Tomlinson has cut his schedule to ensure he is fully fit for the European Indoor Championships.\\n \\n The 23-year-old has a minor injury and has pulled out of international meets in Madrid and Lievin this week as well as warm-weather training in Lanzarote. \\\"It's nothing serious,\\\" said his coach Peter Stanley. \\\"He strained a muscle in his abdomen at the Birmingham meeting but is back in full training.\\\" Sprinter Mark Lewis-Francis will also not compete in Madrid on Thursday. The Birmingham athlete, who clocked a season's best of 6.61 seconds over 60m in Birmingham last week, also prefers to focus his attentions on next month's European Indoor Championships.\\n \\n Lewis-Francis, who was runner-up to British team-mate Jason Gardener at the Europeans three years ago, will continue his training at home. Meanwhile, Tomlinson is still searching for this first major medal and this season he has shown he could be in the sort of form to grab a spot on the podium in Madrid. The Middlesbrough athlete jumped a season's best of 7.95m at the Birmingham Grand Prix - good enough to push world indoor champion Savante Stringfellow into second.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"entertainment\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The latest scandal at Bank of China will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that China's big four banks are ready for international listings. Government policy sees the bank listings as vital economic reforms. Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. The other is China Construction Bank. Both are expected to list abroad during 2005.\\n \\n They shared a $45bn state bailout in 2003, to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut.\\n \\n However, a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal. Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder. China's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. Officially, one in five loans is not being repaid. Attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. The most high-profile case involved the ex-president of Bank of China, Wang Xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003. Although, he committed the offences whilst running Bank of China in New York, Mr Wang was head of China Construction Bank when the scandal broke. Earlier this month, a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.\\n \\n China's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. The introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector, but links between banks and local government remain strong. Last year, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches, and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised, in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. China's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China's economic boom. But two problems persist. First, inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people. Second, many questionable loans come not from the big four, but from smaller banks. Another high profile financial firm, China Life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following its 2004 New York listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.\\n\",\n          \"Portable PlayStation ready to go\\n \\n Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP) will go on sale in Japan on 12 December.\\n \\n The long-awaited handheld game playing gadget will cost about 19,800 yen (145 euros) when it hits the shelves. At launch 21 games will be available for the PSP, including Need for Speed, Ridge Racer, Metal Gear Acid and Vampire Chronicle. Sony has not yet announced when the PSP will be available in Europe and the US, but analysts expect it to debut in those territories in early 2005.\\n \\n Fifa 2005 is back at the top of the UK games charts, a week after losing it to rival Pro Evolution Soccer 4. Konami's Pro Evo dropped only one place to two, while the only new entry in the top 10 was another football title, LMA Manager 2005, in at number seven. Tony Hawk's Underground 2 held its own at three, while Star Wars Battlefront inched up to four places to four. There was good news for Disney, with the spin-off from the Shark's Tale film moving up the charts into number eight.\\n \\n Fans of the Gran Turismo series in Europe are going to have to wait until next year for the latest version. Sony has said that the PAL version of GT4 will not be ready for Christmas. \\\"The product is localised into 13 different languages across the PAL territories, therefore the process takes considerably longer than it does in Japan,\\\" it said. Gran Turismo 4 for the PlayStation 2 is still expected to be released in Japan and the USA this year.\\n \\n Halo 2 has broken video game records, with pre-orders of more than 1.5 million in the US alone. Some 6,500 US stores plan to open just after midnight on Tuesday 9 November for the game's release. \\\"Halo 2 is projected to bring in more revenue than any day one box office blockbuster movie in the United States,\\\" said Xbox's Peter Moore. \\\"We've even heard rumours of fan anticipation of the 'Halo 2 flu' on 9 November.\\\"\\n\",\n          \"Tomlinson stays focused on Europe\\n \\n Long jumper Chris Tomlinson has cut his schedule to ensure he is fully fit for the European Indoor Championships.\\n \\n The 23-year-old has a minor injury and has pulled out of international meets in Madrid and Lievin this week as well as warm-weather training in Lanzarote. \\\"It's nothing serious,\\\" said his coach Peter Stanley. \\\"He strained a muscle in his abdomen at the Birmingham meeting but is back in full training.\\\" Sprinter Mark Lewis-Francis will also not compete in Madrid on Thursday. The Birmingham athlete, who clocked a season's best of 6.61 seconds over 60m in Birmingham last week, also prefers to focus his attentions on next month's European Indoor Championships.\\n \\n Lewis-Francis, who was runner-up to British team-mate Jason Gardener at the Europeans three years ago, will continue his training at home. Meanwhile, Tomlinson is still searching for this first major medal and this season he has shown he could be in the sort of form to grab a spot on the podium in Madrid. The Middlesbrough athlete jumped a season's best of 7.95m at the Birmingham Grand Prix - good enough to push world indoor champion Savante Stringfellow into second.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"entertainment\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The latest scandal at Bank of China will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that China's big four banks are ready for international listings. Government policy sees the bank listings as vital economic reforms. Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. The other is China Construction Bank. Both are expected to list abroad during 2005.\\n \\n They shared a $45bn state bailout in 2003, to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut.\\n \\n However, a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal. Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder. China's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. Officially, one in five loans is not being repaid. Attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. The most high-profile case involved the ex-president of Bank of China, Wang Xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003. Although, he committed the offences whilst running Bank of China in New York, Mr Wang was head of China Construction Bank when the scandal broke. Earlier this month, a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.\\n \\n China's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. The introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector, but links between banks and local government remain strong. Last year, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches, and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised, in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. China's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China's economic boom. But two problems persist. First, inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people. Second, many questionable loans come not from the big four, but from smaller banks. Another high profile financial firm, China Life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following its 2004 New York listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.\\n\",\n          \"Portable PlayStation ready to go\\n \\n Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP) will go on sale in Japan on 12 December.\\n \\n The long-awaited handheld game playing gadget will cost about 19,800 yen (145 euros) when it hits the shelves. At launch 21 games will be available for the PSP, including Need for Speed, Ridge Racer, Metal Gear Acid and Vampire Chronicle. Sony has not yet announced when the PSP will be available in Europe and the US, but analysts expect it to debut in those territories in early 2005.\\n \\n Fifa 2005 is back at the top of the UK games charts, a week after losing it to rival Pro Evolution Soccer 4. Konami's Pro Evo dropped only one place to two, while the only new entry in the top 10 was another football title, LMA Manager 2005, in at number seven. Tony Hawk's Underground 2 held its own at three, while Star Wars Battlefront inched up to four places to four. There was good news for Disney, with the spin-off from the Shark's Tale film moving up the charts into number eight.\\n \\n Fans of the Gran Turismo series in Europe are going to have to wait until next year for the latest version. Sony has said that the PAL version of GT4 will not be ready for Christmas. \\\"The product is localised into 13 different languages across the PAL territories, therefore the process takes considerably longer than it does in Japan,\\\" it said. Gran Turismo 4 for the PlayStation 2 is still expected to be released in Japan and the USA this year.\\n \\n Halo 2 has broken video game records, with pre-orders of more than 1.5 million in the US alone. Some 6,500 US stores plan to open just after midnight on Tuesday 9 November for the game's release. \\\"Halo 2 is projected to bring in more revenue than any day one box office blockbuster movie in the United States,\\\" said Xbox's Peter Moore. \\\"We've even heard rumours of fan anticipation of the 'Halo 2 flu' on 9 November.\\\"\\n\",\n          \"Tomlinson stays focused on Europe\\n \\n Long jumper Chris Tomlinson has cut his schedule to ensure he is fully fit for the European Indoor Championships.\\n \\n The 23-year-old has a minor injury and has pulled out of international meets in Madrid and Lievin this week as well as warm-weather training in Lanzarote. \\\"It's nothing serious,\\\" said his coach Peter Stanley. \\\"He strained a muscle in his abdomen at the Birmingham meeting but is back in full training.\\\" Sprinter Mark Lewis-Francis will also not compete in Madrid on Thursday. The Birmingham athlete, who clocked a season's best of 6.61 seconds over 60m in Birmingham last week, also prefers to focus his attentions on next month's European Indoor Championships.\\n \\n Lewis-Francis, who was runner-up to British team-mate Jason Gardener at the Europeans three years ago, will continue his training at home. Meanwhile, Tomlinson is still searching for this first major medal and this season he has shown he could be in the sort of form to grab a spot on the podium in Madrid. The Middlesbrough athlete jumped a season's best of 7.95m at the Birmingham Grand Prix - good enough to push world indoor champion Savante Stringfellow into second.\\n\"\n        ],\n

BT is starting its push into television with plans to offer TV over broadband\\n \\n As a telecoms company BT is moving to a content distribution strategy Andrew Burke chief of BTs new Entertainment unit told the IPTV World Forum We want to be an entertainment facilitator he said on the opening day of the London conference The BBC is also trialling a service to play programmes over the net and has not ruled out offering it to nonlicence fee payers overseas The corporations Interactive Media Player iMP is its first foray into broadband TV known as IPTV Internet Protocol TV\\n \\n We see several opportunities for delivering the type of content that normally broadcasters find it difficult to get to viewers said BTs Andrew Burke\\n \\n With more people on broadband and connection speeds increasing telcos around the world are looking for new ways to make money from it Increased competition between net service providers encouraged by Ofcom has eroded BTs position in the market It is looking for a good return on its investment in the technology which has made broadband over ADSL a reality It also sees delivering TV over broadband as a way of getting highdefinition HD content to people sooner than they will be able to get it through conventional regular broadcasts The BBCs iMP has just finished successful technical trials and is set for much larger consumer trials later in Before it officially launches the BBC must show the government how it offers value for money Delivering programmes over broadband offers clear public value says the BBC because it gives people more control and more choice\\n \\n IPTV is a similar idea to VoIP services like Skype Both use broadband net connections to carry information like video and voice in packets of data instead of conventional means Since it uses internet technology IPTV could mean more choice of programmes more more interactivity tailored programming and more localised content outside of conventional satellite digital cable and terrestrial broadcasts\\n \\n It is all part of the larger changing TV technology landscape and like personal digital video recorders PVRs gives people much more control over TV Broadcasters see IPTV and PVRs as both as a threat and an opportunity The BBC recognises that TV over broadband is a reality and aims to innovate with it said Rahul Chakkara controller of BBCis interactive TV services The iMP is based on peertopeer technology and lets people download programmes the BBC owns the rights to for up to seven days after broadcast IPTV enables us to take back that programme to our audience at different times said Mr Chakkara\\n \\n So we can tell our audience that that programme they paid for via the licence fee they can access it any time they want It helps said Mr Burke that people are more au fait with terms like digital interactive now that digital TV reaches more than of UK homes According to Benoit Joly from broadband telecoms firm Thales of Europe cannot get satellite TV or digital TV They could get IPTV though Analysts say that IPTV will account for of the digital TV market in Europe alone by the end of the decade What needs to happen now agree analysts is for connection speeds to be bumped up to handle the service Mbps connections would be ideal BT does not see itself as a broadcaster of IPTV services rather as an enabler said Mr Burke Its strategy is a hybrid approach he explained where overtheair conventional broadcasts are supplemented with content over broadband\\n \\n Initially appealing to niche markets like sports fans it will widen out But IPTV could be used for homemonitoring pet cams localised news services and local authority TV too says BT It even suggests that it could target those households in the UK that do not own a computer of the country\\n \\n Broadband to them would not be about data and the net that could come later for them but about cheap phone calls and more choice of TV programmes Home Choice already offers hours of shows and channels delivered over broadband to homes in London With a broadband net subscription you can also get your TV and phone service Through content deals and partnerships it offers satellite as well as terrestrial channels and bespoke channels based on what viewers pick and choose from its catalogues It aims to expand nationally but is seeing a lot of success with what it offers its subscribers now and aims to double uptake as well as reach by the summer Although still at a very early stage IPTV is another application for broadband that underlines its growing prominence as a backbone network another utility like electricity\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The latest scandal at Bank of China will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that China's big four banks are ready for international listings. Government policy sees the bank listings as vital economic reforms. Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. The other is China Construction Bank. Both are expected to list abroad during 2005.\\n \\n They shared a $45bn state bailout in 2003, to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut.\\n \\n However, a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal. Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder. China's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. Officially, one in five loans is not being repaid. Attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. The most high-profile case involved the ex-president of Bank of China, Wang Xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003. Although, he committed the offences whilst running Bank of China in New York, Mr Wang was head of China Construction Bank when the scandal broke. Earlier this month, a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.\\n \\n China's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. The introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector, but links between banks and local government remain strong. Last year, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches, and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised, in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. China's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China's economic boom. But two problems persist. First, inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people. Second, many questionable loans come not from the big four, but from smaller banks. Another high profile financial firm, China Life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following its 2004 New York listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.\\n\",\n          \"Portable PlayStation ready to go\\n \\n Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP) will go on sale in Japan on 12 December.\\n \\n The long-awaited handheld game playing gadget will cost about 19,800 yen (145 euros) when it hits the shelves. At launch 21 games will be available for the PSP, including Need for Speed, Ridge Racer, Metal Gear Acid and Vampire Chronicle. Sony has not yet announced when the PSP will be available in Europe and the US, but analysts expect it to debut in those territories in early 2005.\\n \\n Fifa 2005 is back at the top of the UK games charts, a week after losing it to rival Pro Evolution Soccer 4. Konami's Pro Evo dropped only one place to two, while the only new entry in the top 10 was another football title, LMA Manager 2005, in at number seven. Tony Hawk's Underground 2 held its own at three, while Star Wars Battlefront inched up to four places to four. There was good news for Disney, with the spin-off from the Shark's Tale film moving up the charts into number eight.\\n \\n Fans of the Gran Turismo series in Europe are going to have to wait until next year for the latest version. Sony has said that the PAL version of GT4 will not be ready for Christmas. \\\"The product is localised into 13 different languages across the PAL territories, therefore the process takes considerably longer than it does in Japan,\\\" it said. Gran Turismo 4 for the PlayStation 2 is still expected to be released in Japan and the USA this year.\\n \\n Halo 2 has broken video game records, with pre-orders of more than 1.5 million in the US alone. Some 6,500 US stores plan to open just after midnight on Tuesday 9 November for the game's release. \\\"Halo 2 is projected to bring in more revenue than any day one box office blockbuster movie in the United States,\\\" said Xbox's Peter Moore. \\\"We've even heard rumours of fan anticipation of the 'Halo 2 flu' on 9 November.\\\"\\n\",\n          \"Tomlinson stays focused on Europe\\n \\n Long jumper Chris Tomlinson has cut his schedule to ensure he is fully fit for the European Indoor Championships.\\n \\n The 23-year-old has a minor injury and has pulled out of international meets in Madrid and Lievin this week as well as warm-weather training in Lanzarote. \\\"It's nothing serious,\\\" said his coach Peter Stanley. \\\"He strained a muscle in his abdomen at the Birmingham meeting but is back in full training.\\\" Sprinter Mark Lewis-Francis will also not compete in Madrid on Thursday. The Birmingham athlete, who clocked a season's best of 6.61 seconds over 60m in Birmingham last week, also prefers to focus his attentions on next month's European Indoor Championships.\\n \\n Lewis-Francis, who was runner-up to British team-mate Jason Gardener at the Europeans three years ago, will continue his training at home. Meanwhile, Tomlinson is still searching for this first major medal and this season he has shown he could be in the sort of form to grab a spot on the podium in Madrid. The Middlesbrough athlete jumped a season's best of 7.95m at the Birmingham Grand Prix - good enough to push world indoor champion Savante Stringfellow into second.\\n\"\n        ],\n

BT is starting its push into television with plans to offer TV over broadband\\n \\n As a telecoms company BT is moving to a content distribution strategy Andrew Burke chief of BTs new Entertainment unit told the IPTV World Forum We want to be an entertainment facilitator he said on the opening day of the London conference The BBC is also trialling a service to play programmes over the net and has not ruled out offering it to nonlicence fee payers overseas The corporations Interactive Media Player iMP is its first foray into broadband TV known as IPTV Internet Protocol TV\\n \\n We see several opportunities for delivering the type of content that normally broadcasters find it difficult to get to viewers said BTs Andrew Burke\\n \\n With more people on broadband and connection speeds increasing telcos around the world are looking for new ways to make money from it Increased competition between net service providers encouraged by Ofcom has eroded BTs position in the market It is looking for a good return on its investment in the technology which has made broadband over ADSL a reality It also sees delivering TV over broadband as a way of getting highdefinition HD content to people sooner than they will be able to get it through conventional regular broadcasts The BBCs iMP has just finished successful technical trials and is set for much larger consumer trials later in Before it officially launches the BBC must show the government how it offers value for money Delivering programmes over broadband offers clear public value says the BBC because it gives people more control and more choice\\n \\n IPTV is a similar idea to VoIP services like Skype Both use broadband net connections to carry information like video and voice in packets of data instead of conventional means Since it uses internet technology IPTV could mean more choice of programmes more more interactivity tailored programming and more localised content outside of conventional satellite digital cable and terrestrial broadcasts\\n \\n It is all part of the larger changing TV technology landscape and like personal digital video recorders PVRs gives people much more control over TV Broadcasters see IPTV and PVRs as both as a threat and an opportunity The BBC recognises that TV over broadband is a reality and aims to innovate with it said Rahul Chakkara controller of BBCis interactive TV services The iMP is based on peertopeer technology and lets people download programmes the BBC owns the rights to for up to seven days after broadcast IPTV enables us to take back that programme to our audience at different times said Mr Chakkara\\n \\n So we can tell our audience that that programme they paid for via the licence fee they can access it any time they want It helps said Mr Burke that people are more au fait with terms like digital interactive now that digital TV reaches more than of UK homes According to Benoit Joly from broadband telecoms firm Thales of Europe cannot get satellite TV or digital TV They could get IPTV though Analysts say that IPTV will account for of the digital TV market in Europe alone by the end of the decade What needs to happen now agree analysts is for connection speeds to be bumped up to handle the service Mbps connections would be ideal BT does not see itself as a broadcaster of IPTV services rather as an enabler said Mr Burke Its strategy is a hybrid approach he explained where overtheair conventional broadcasts are supplemented with content over broadband\\n \\n Initially appealing to niche markets like sports fans it will widen out But IPTV could be used for homemonitoring pet cams localised news services and local authority TV too says BT It even suggests that it could target those households in the UK that do not own a computer of the country\\n \\n Broadband to them would not be about data and the net that could come later for them but about cheap phone calls and more choice of TV programmes Home Choice already offers hours of shows and channels delivered over broadband to homes in London With a broadband net subscription you can also get your TV and phone service Through content deals and partnerships it offers satellite as well as terrestrial channels and bespoke channels based on what viewers pick and choose from its catalogues It aims to expand nationally but is seeing a lot of success with what it offers its subscribers now and aims to double uptake as well as reach by the summer Although still at a very early stage IPTV is another application for broadband that underlines its growing prominence as a backbone network another utility like electricity\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

The latest scandal at Bank of China will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that China's big four banks are ready for international listings. Government policy sees the bank listings as vital economic reforms. Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. The other is China Construction Bank. Both are expected to list abroad during 2005.\\n \\n They shared a $45bn state bailout in 2003, to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut.\\n \\n However, a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal. Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder. China's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. Officially, one in five loans is not being repaid. Attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. The most high-profile case involved the ex-president of Bank of China, Wang Xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003. Although, he committed the offences whilst running Bank of China in New York, Mr Wang was head of China Construction Bank when the scandal broke. Earlier this month, a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.\\n \\n China's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. The introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector, but links between banks and local government remain strong. Last year, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches, and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised, in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. China's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China's economic boom. But two problems persist. First, inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people. Second, many questionable loans come not from the big four, but from smaller banks. Another high profile financial firm, China Life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following its 2004 New York listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.\\n\",\n          \"Portable PlayStation ready to go\\n \\n Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP) will go on sale in Japan on 12 December.\\n \\n The long-awaited handheld game playing gadget will cost about 19,800 yen (145 euros) when it hits the shelves. At launch 21 games will be available for the PSP, including Need for Speed, Ridge Racer, Metal Gear Acid and Vampire Chronicle. Sony has not yet announced when the PSP will be available in Europe and the US, but analysts expect it to debut in those territories in early 2005.\\n \\n Fifa 2005 is back at the top of the UK games charts, a week after losing it to rival Pro Evolution Soccer 4. Konami's Pro Evo dropped only one place to two, while the only new entry in the top 10 was another football title, LMA Manager 2005, in at number seven. Tony Hawk's Underground 2 held its own at three, while Star Wars Battlefront inched up to four places to four. There was good news for Disney, with the spin-off from the Shark's Tale film moving up the charts into number eight.\\n \\n Fans of the Gran Turismo series in Europe are going to have to wait until next year for the latest version. Sony has said that the PAL version of GT4 will not be ready for Christmas. \\\"The product is localised into 13 different languages across the PAL territories, therefore the process takes considerably longer than it does in Japan,\\\" it said. Gran Turismo 4 for the PlayStation 2 is still expected to be released in Japan and the USA this year.\\n \\n Halo 2 has broken video game records, with pre-orders of more than 1.5 million in the US alone. Some 6,500 US stores plan to open just after midnight on Tuesday 9 November for the game's release. \\\"Halo 2 is projected to bring in more revenue than any day one box office blockbuster movie in the United States,\\\" said Xbox's Peter Moore. \\\"We've even heard rumours of fan anticipation of the 'Halo 2 flu' on 9 November.\\\"\\n\",\n          \"Tomlinson stays focused on Europe\\n \\n Long jumper Chris Tomlinson has cut his schedule to ensure he is fully fit for the European Indoor Championships.\\n \\n The 23-year-old has a minor injury and has pulled out of international meets in Madrid and Lievin this week as well as warm-weather training in Lanzarote. \\\"It's nothing serious,\\\" said his coach Peter Stanley. \\\"He strained a muscle in his abdomen at the Birmingham meeting but is back in full training.\\\" Sprinter Mark Lewis-Francis will also not compete in Madrid on Thursday. The Birmingham athlete, who clocked a season's best of 6.61 seconds over 60m in Birmingham last week, also prefers to focus his attentions on next month's European Indoor Championships.\\n \\n Lewis-Francis, who was runner-up to British team-mate Jason Gardener at the Europeans three years ago, will continue his training at home. Meanwhile, Tomlinson is still searching for this first major medal and this season he has shown he could be in the sort of form to grab a spot on the podium in Madrid. The Middlesbrough athlete jumped a season's best of 7.95m at the Birmingham Grand Prix - good enough to push world indoor champion Savante Stringfellow into second.\\n\"\n        ],\n

BT is starting its push into television with plans to offer TV over broadband\\n \\n As a telecoms company BT is moving to a content distribution strategy Andrew Burke chief of BTs new Entertainment unit told the IPTV World Forum We want to be an entertainment facilitator he said on the opening day of the London conference The BBC is also trialling a service to play programmes over the net and has not ruled out offering it to nonlicence fee payers overseas The corporations Interactive Media Player iMP is its first foray into broadband TV known as IPTV Internet Protocol TV\\n \\n We see several opportunities for delivering the type of content that normally broadcasters find it difficult to get to viewers said BTs Andrew Burke\\n \\n With more people on broadband and connection speeds increasing telcos around the world are looking for new ways to make money from it Increased competition between net service providers encouraged by Ofcom has eroded BTs position in the market It is looking for a good return on its investment in the technology which has made broadband over ADSL a reality It also sees delivering TV over broadband as a way of getting highdefinition HD content to people sooner than they will be able to get it through conventional regular broadcasts The BBCs iMP has just finished successful technical trials and is set for much larger consumer trials later in Before it officially launches the BBC must show the government how it offers value for money Delivering programmes over broadband offers clear public value says the BBC because it gives people more control and more choice\\n \\n IPTV is a similar idea to VoIP services like Skype Both use broadband net connections to carry information like video and voice in packets of data instead of conventional means Since it uses internet technology IPTV could mean more choice of programmes more more interactivity tailored programming and more localised content outside of conventional satellite digital cable and terrestrial broadcasts\\n \\n It is all part of the larger changing TV technology landscape and like personal digital video recorders PVRs gives people much more control over TV Broadcasters see IPTV and PVRs as both as a threat and an opportunity The BBC recognises that TV over broadband is a reality and aims to innovate with it said Rahul Chakkara controller of BBCis interactive TV services The iMP is based on peertopeer technology and lets people download programmes the BBC owns the rights to for up to seven days after broadcast IPTV enables us to take back that programme to our audience at different times said Mr Chakkara\\n \\n So we can tell our audience that that programme they paid for via the licence fee they can access it any time they want It helps said Mr Burke that people are more au fait with terms like digital interactive now that digital TV reaches more than of UK homes According to Benoit Joly from broadband telecoms firm Thales of Europe cannot get satellite TV or digital TV They could get IPTV though Analysts say that IPTV will account for of the digital TV market in Europe alone by the end of the decade What needs to happen now agree analysts is for connection speeds to be bumped up to handle the service Mbps connections would be ideal BT does not see itself as a broadcaster of IPTV services rather as an enabler said Mr Burke Its strategy is a hybrid approach he explained where overtheair conventional broadcasts are supplemented with content over broadband\\n \\n Initially appealing to niche markets like sports fans it will widen out But IPTV could be used for homemonitoring pet cams localised news services and local authority TV too says BT It even suggests that it could target those households in the UK that do not own a computer of the country\\n \\n Broadband to them would not be about data and the net that could come later for them but about cheap phone calls and more choice of TV programmes Home Choice already offers hours of shows and channels delivered over broadband to homes in London With a broadband net subscription you can also get your TV and phone service Through content deals and partnerships it offers satellite as well as terrestrial channels and bespoke channels based on what viewers pick and choose from its catalogues It aims to expand nationally but is seeing a lot of success with what it offers its subscribers now and aims to double uptake as well as reach by the summer Although still at a very early stage IPTV is another application for broadband that underlines its growing prominence as a backbone network another utility like electricity\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n
